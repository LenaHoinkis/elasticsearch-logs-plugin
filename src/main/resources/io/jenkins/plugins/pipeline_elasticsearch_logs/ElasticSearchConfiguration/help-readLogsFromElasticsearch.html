  <p>When logging to Elasticsearch is enabled build logs are not written to the Jenkins filesystem anymore.
  By default the build logs in the Jenkins UI and API will be empty.</p>
  
  <p>By enabling this check-box the logs are read from Elasticsearch every time they are accessed from UI or API.</p>

  <p>Be aware that this might have a negative impact on the performance and resource consumption of Elasticsearch and Jenkins.</p>
